# Vision and Principles

We want a community-driven PSLE Maths bootcamp that builds confidence through safe, supportive practice. The system celebrates effort, helps students reflect on mistakes, and guides them toward mastery.

## User stories

- Student: I can practice at my level, get hints and friendly feedback, and see my progress grow.
- Student: I can make mistakes without penalty and learn why I got it wrong.
- Parent/Guardian: I can see strengths and focus areas, with suggestions for home support.
- Trainer: I can curate topics, assign practice, and see common errors and careless patterns.
- Admin: I can manage users, topics, and content versions safely.

## Principles

- Encouraging and strengths-based tone.
- Mistake-friendly: emphasize reflection, not punishment.
- Respect attention spans: short, clear, visually friendly.
- Inclusive by design: accessible language, device-friendly layouts.
- Transparent recommendations: explain the “why.”

## Success metrics (examples)

- Weekly active students and completion of short sessions.
- Reduced careless mistakes over time for each student.
- Improved mastery confidence per topic/skill.
- Trainer adoption and content contributions.
