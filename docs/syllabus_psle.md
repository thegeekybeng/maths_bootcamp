## Numbers and Operations

- Whole Numbers and Place Value (F/S) — read, write, compare numbers; rounding; factors/multiples.
- Fractions (F/S/Stretch) — equivalent fractions; addition/subtraction; multiplication/division; mixed numbers.
- Decimals (F/S) — place value; operations; rounding; conversion with fractions.
- Percentages (S/Stretch) — percent of quantity; increase/decrease; GST/discount contexts.
- Ratios (S/Stretch) — part:part and part:whole; scaling; ratio-fraction-percent links.

## Measurement and Geometry

- Length, Mass, Volume (F/S) — units, conversions, perimeter; volume of cuboids/cubes.
- Time (F/S) — 12/24-hour clock; elapsed time; timetables.
- Area (S) — rectangles, triangles, composite figures; unit conversions.
- Angles and Triangles (S) — angle properties on lines, at a point; triangle types and properties.
- Circles (S/Stretch) — radius/diameter; circumference; area; word problems.
- Nets and 3D Solids (S) — faces/edges/vertices; nets of cubes/cuboids.

## Algebra and Functions

- Numerical Patterns (F/S) — term-to-term rules; simple sequences.
- Algebraic Thinking (S) — unknowns; simple expressions and equations; balance idea.

## Data and Statistics

- Tables and Graphs (F/S) — bar, line, picture graphs; reading and interpreting.
- Average/Mean (S) — equal sharing and rebalancing logic.

## Problem Solving Heuristics (Across Strands)

- Draw a diagram/organize info.
- Work backwards.
- Make a systematic list.
- Look for patterns.
- Guess and check (smartly).
- Simplify the problem.

## Exam-aligned Notes

- Emphasize multi-step word problems across topics.
- Integrate units, reasonableness checks, and error-spotting.
- Include careless-error training (misread question, unit mismatch, off-by-one, operation slip).
